## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am an aspiring analytical and research-minded Data Scientist with a background in chemical, mathematical, and materials science. Currently, I am enrolled in an 
intensive Data Science & Analytics program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) where I learn all of the required industry tools and software, such as SQL, 
Python, Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Applied Artificial Intelligence, from current industry professionals. With a team-oriented attitude, I am eager to 
contribute to organizations and companies through interpreting data regarding machine learning, semiconductors, sensor data, and other technological data which can 
provide relevant information to be leveraged in effective administrative decision-making.
